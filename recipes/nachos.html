    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I load these nachos with sour cream,
             salsa, sliced olives, jalape√±os, 
             and chopped green onion, 
             but all these toppings are optional - use what you like! I have made many, many plates of loaded nachos before settling on this version. I have also made them with turkey, and a vegetarian version, but really enjoy them with beef.</p>
