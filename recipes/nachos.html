    <h1>Nachos</h1>

    <img src="/pictures/nachos.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I load these nachos with sour cream,
             salsa, sliced olives, jalapeños, 
             and chopped green onion, 
             but all these toppings are optional - use what you like! I have made many, many plates of loaded nachos before settling on this version. I have also made them with turkey, and a vegetarian version, but really enjoy them with beef.</p>

    <h4>Directions</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>To make the taco seasoning: Stir paprika, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>To make the beef mixture: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion and green pepper; cook and stir with oil and juices from browned meat until much of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Stir 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and Mexican-style corn into skillet. Season beef mixture to taste with prepared taco seasoning mix.</li>
                <li>Stir together the remaining 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until heated through, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>To assemble the nachos: Lay half of tortilla chips in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate; drop teaspoons of refried beans onto chips, followed by beef mixture and shredded cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, beans, beef, and cheese to make a second layer.</li>
                <li>Microwave on High until cheese is melted and nachos are warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with sour cream, salsa, olives, jalapeños, and green onion as desired.</li>
            </ol>
